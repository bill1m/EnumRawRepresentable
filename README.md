#  Enum RawRepresentable

I was working through a [Ray Wenderlich tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/10877734-reusable-swiftui-views-in-the-raywenderlich-com-app) on *Reusable SwiftUI Views* which used an enum to *Manage Colors and Styles* on a Button view (tutorial lesson #3.)  

While not the exact solution used in that lesson, I wondered if the **enum** could conform to **RawRepresentable** as part of the solution.

I then found this [blog by Ole Begemann](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/11/rawrepresentable/) which provided an example. So, I  grew this project to exercise both lessons learned.

Thanks to both Ray Wenderlich and Ole Begemann.
